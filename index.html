<p style="color:purple;">Vaishali, Vesali or Vaiśālī was an ancient city located in present-day Bihar, India.
 It is now an archaeological site and forms part of the Vaishali District in Tirhut Division.[1]

It was the capital city of the Vajjika League of Vrijji mahajanapada,
 considered one of the first examples of a republic around the 6th century BCE.
 Gautama Buddha preached his last sermon before his death in c.
  483 BCE, then in 383 BCE the Second Buddhist council was convened here by King Kalasoka,
 making it an important place in both Jain and Buddhist religions.
 [2][3] It contains one of the best-preserved of the Pillars of Ashoka, topped by a single Asiatic lion.

Vaishali is also home to possibly the earliest known example of a stupa,
 the Buddha relic stupa which is said to contain the ashes of the Buddha.[4][5]

The city finds mention in the travel accounts of Chinese explorers, 
Faxian (4th century CE) and Xuanzang (7th century CE), 
which were later used in 1861 by British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham to 
first identify Vaiśālī with the present village of Basarh in Vaishali District, Bihar.[6][7]</p>

Ancient Vaishali
Main article: Vaishali (ancient city)
According to legend, Vaishali derives its name from King Vishala, a son of Ikshvaku who founded the city.
 Vaishali was the capital of the vibrant Licchavi republic and was closely associated with the early histories of both Buddhism and Jainism.
 [5] In that period, Vaishali was an ancient metropolis and the capital city of the republic of the Vajji confederation,
 which covered most of the Himalayan Gangetic region of present-day Bihar.
 Magadha rulers of the Shishunaga dynasty shifted their capital from Pataliputra to Vaishali.</p>
